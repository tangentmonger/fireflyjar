Firefly Jar
===========

LED effects to create a jar of fireflies. Based on [this jar of fireflies by Keso](http://www.instructables.com/id/Jar-of-Fireflies/), but this one uses strings of tiny LEDs to create a "flight" animation, and tapping on the lid causes the fireflies to react.

I've never actually seen fireflies for real. They don't live in my country, so I'm relying on [videos](https://youtu.be/RpywSqvXDqc?t=166) like [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUqSByTdGoU&t=103) to know what they should look like.

Each firefly consists of twelve green SMD LEDs, Charlieplexed on four thin enamelled wires. The five fireflies are controlled by an Arduino Nano hidden in the lid. A piezo sensor under the lid detects taps.
